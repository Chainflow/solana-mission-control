## Monitoring 

Monitoring is provided via three customized Grafana dashboards.  The dashboards provide consolidated, user-friendly, yet comprehensive views of a validator infrastucture's health.

### 1. Validator monitoring metricss

The following list of metrics are displayed in this dashboard.

- **Validator Identity**

  *Validator public Key*: Node public key of the validator

  *Validator vote key*: Vote Key of the validator

- **Validator Information**

    *Solana node version*: Current version of the solana

    *Solana node health*: Current health of the solana node, if it is running fine it marked as **UP** or else marked as **DOWN**

    *IP Address*: Gossip network address for the node
    
    *Vote Account*: Shows information about whether the validator is voting or jailed, If the validator is voting account it marked as **YES** or else **NO**
    
    *Validator Active stake*: Displays the stake, delegated to this vote account and active in this epoch
        
    *Commision*: Validator's vote account commision, percentage (0-100) of rewards payout owed to the vote account.

- **validator Health**

    *Network Epoch*: Displays network's epoch height 

    *Validator Epoch*: Displays validator's epoch height

    *Epoch Difference*: Difference between validator's and network's epoch height

    *Validator status*: Shows validator's status whether the validator is voting or jailed, If the validator is voting then it displayed as **VOTING** or else displayed as **JAILED**

- **Validator Performance**

    *Block Height - Network*: Displays the latest block height of a network
    
    *Block Height - Validator*: Displays the latest block height committed by the validator
    
    *Height Difference*: Displays Block Height Difference of network and validator's block height

    *Solana Blocktime*: Displays estimated production time of a confirmed block
    
    *Vote Height - Network*: Displays the latest vote height of network
    
    *Vote Height - Validator*: Displays the latest vote height committed by validator

    *Vote Height Difference*: Displays height difference of network and validator's vote height

    *Account Balance*: Displays Account Balance of validator in SOL's
    
    *Solana current slot height*: Displays Current slot height 
    
    *Confirmed Blocktime - Network*: Displays estimated production time of confirmed block of Network
    
    *Confirmed Blocktime - Validator*: Displays estimated production time of confirmed block committed by validator
        
    *Block Time Difference*: Difference between confirmation time of network and validator

    *Current Epoch - Vote credits*: Displays total current epoch vote credits of validator vote account

    *Previous Epoch - Vote credits*: Displays total previous epoch vote credits of validator vote account
    
    *Total valid slots*: Displays number of leader valid slots per leader
    
    *Total skipped slots*: Displays number of leader skipped slots per leader

- **Validator Details**

   *Solana slot leader*: Displays current slot leader address as base-58 encoded string 
   
   *Transaction Count*: Displays current total transaction count from the ledger
   
   *Validator last voted*: Displays most recent slot voted on by this vote account
   
   *Solana confirmed slot height*: Displays current slot height
    
   *Current Active Validators*: Displays the number of current active validators, i.e validators who are voting 
    
   *Delinquent validators*: Displays the number of delinquent validators, i.e validators who are jailed.

   *Confirmed epoch last slot*: Displays current epoch's last slot

   *Validator Root slot*: Displays Root slot per validator

**Note**: The above mentioned metrics will be calculated and displayed according to the validator address which will be configured in config.toml.      

### 2. System Monitoring Metrics

This view provides a comprehensive look at system performance metrics, expanding on the summary dashboard. Here's you'll find all the system metrics you'd expect to see in a comprehensive system monitoring tool.

These metrics are are collected by the node_exporter and displays all the metrics related to

- CPU
- Memory
- Disk
- Network traffic
- System processes
- Systemd
- Storage
- Hardware Misc
   
### 3. Summary Dashboard

This dashboard displays a quick information summary of validator details and system metrics. It includes following details.

- Validator identity (validator public key, validator vote key)
- Validator summary which includes  
         Voting Account, Validator status,Node status,
         Block Height - Network, Block Height - Validator, Block Height Difference 
         Validator Commision, Active stake, Current Epoch Vote Credits
- Server Uptime, CPU Busy, RAM Used, CPU, Memory Stake, Network Traffic, Disk Space Used, Disk IOps, I/O usage Read/Write, I/O Usage Times are the metrics being displayed from System details.
