## Monitoring 

Monitoring is provided via three customized Grafana dashboards.  The dashboards provide consolidated, user-friendly, yet comprehensive views of a validator infrastucture's health.

    Solana current slot height:
        Displays Current slot height 
    
    Confirmed Blocktime - Network:
         Displays estimated production time of confirmed block of Network
    
    Confirmed Blocktime - Validator:
         Displays estimated production time of confirmed block committed by validator
        
    Block Time Difference:

    Current Epoch - vote credits:
        Displays total current epoch vote credits of validator vote account

    Previous Epoch - Vote credits:
        Displays total previous epoch vote credits of validator vote account
    
    Total valid slots:
       Displays number of leader valid slots per leader
    
    Total skipped slots:
       Displays number of leader skipped slots per leader

- **Validator Details**

   solana slot leader:
      Displays current slot leader address
   
   Transaction Count:
      Displays current Transaction count from the ledger
   
   Validator last voted:
      Displays Most recent slot voted on by this vote account
   
   Solana confirmed slot height:
      Displays current slot height
    
   Current Active Validators:
       Displays the number of current active validators, i.e validators who are voting 
    
   Delinquent validators:
      Displays the number of delinquent validators, i.e validators who are jailed.

   Confirmed epoch last slot:
      Displays current epoch's last slot

   Validator Root slot:
      Displays Root slot per validator

**Note**: The above mentioned metrics will be calculated and displayed according to the validator address which will be configured in config.toml.      

### 2. System Monitoring Metrics

This view provides a comprehensive look at system performance metrics, expanding on the summary dashboard. Here's you'll find all the system metrics you'd expect to see in a comprehensive system monitoring tool.

These metrics are are collected by the node_exporter and displays all the metrics related to

- CPU
- Memory
- Disk
- Network traffic
- System processes
- Systemd
- Storage
- Hardware Misc
   
### 3. Summary Dashboard

This dashboard displays a quick information summary of validator details and system metrics. It includes following details.

- Validator identity (validator public key, validator vote key)
- Validator summary (Voting power, Validator sttus,Node Health,Block Height Difference) are the metrics being displayed from Validator details.
- CPU usage, RAM Usage, Memory usage and information about disk usage, Total RAM, CPU cores, server UPTime,CPU Basic, Memory Basic are the metrics being displayed from System details.
