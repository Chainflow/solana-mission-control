# solana-prometheus

Solana prometheus monitoring tool provides a comprehensive set of metrics and alerts for solana validator node operators. We utilized the power of Grafana + Node exporter and extended the monitoring & alerting with a custom built go server. It also sends emergency alerts and calls to you based on your configuration.

## Install Prerequisites

- **Go 14.x+**
- **Grafana 7.x+**

### Grafana Dashboards

The repo provides five dashboards

1. Validator Monitoring Metrics - Displays the validator metrics which are calculated and stored in prometheus.
2. System Metrics - Displays the metrics related to your validator server on which this tool is hosted on.
3. Summary - Displays a quick overview of heimdall, bor and system metrics.

Information on all the dashboards can be found [here](./docs/dashboard-desc.md).

## How to import these dashboards in your Grafana installation

### 1. Login to your Grafana dashboard
- Open your web browser and go to http://<your_ip>:3000/. `3000` is the default HTTP port that Grafana listens to if you havenâ€™t configured a different port.
- If you are a first time user type `admin` for the username and password in the login page.
- You can change the password after login.

### 2. Create Datasource

- Select the datasources and click on import.

- To import **system monitoring metrics** click the *plus* button present on left hand side of the dashboard. Click on import and load the system_monitoring_metrics.json present in the grafana_template folder.
